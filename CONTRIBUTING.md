## Reporting bugs
The golden rule is to always **open one issue for one bug**.
If you notice several bugs and want to report them, make sure to create one new issue for each of them.

## Adding new widgets
to add widgets make sure you add related configuation in `/configs/config.go` and add your widget in `/internals/widgets/`.

## Our standards 
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Keep your code minimal az possible and only add features that you need is useful.
- Document your new features in the wiki.
- make sure you add your new configs in `configs/config.go` and `configs/meow.conf`

## TLDR

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch name as your feature/issue
3. When you're finished with the changes, create a PR and close your feature/issue request. don't forget to mention the issue in your commits.
